 * If you are compiling the game for a public server and you're sure that it

 * is caused by the game displaying a message string that is longer than a
 * certain amount of characters, probably the limit is 256 or something like
 * that. Once it happened, the current savegame is corrupted.  However, this
 * corruption does not usually make it impossible to load; instead, it screws up
 * the game in subtle ways.  It may crash randomly in the middle of the game,
 * sometimes it crashes on changing dungeon levels and saves the level you were
 * leaving but not the state of your character, and certain actions will
 * instantly and without fail crash the game.  These actions include any prompts
 * that make the game go through the object or monster array, like wishing for
 * an object, genociding a monster, or a controlled polymorph. Also, farlooking
 * a random stats monster or otherwise causing the game to try displaying its
 * name will crash too.  Since this bug is so severe, and no fix for the root
 * cause has been found yet, the PHANTOM_CRASH_BUG flag attempts to make all
 * messages be shorter than 256 characters, thereby hopefully preventing the bug
 * from striking. */
