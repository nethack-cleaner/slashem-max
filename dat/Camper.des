# Based on some obscure old roguelike game that nobody knows.
# It's called "Castle of the Winds".
# Also partly based on the Yeoman quest. Everything else is my own quest design. --Amy


### The quest "start" level ###
#
#	The Hamlet was the starting town in CoW.
#	This is not an exact reproduction of it, but it comes quite close.

### The quest "goal" level ###
#
#	Inside Part
#
#	Accessible in CoW if you do some hex editing. It used to be prone to crashing the game though.
#	I considered making it crash on purpose here, but changed my mind. Hooray for S'Em Extended players! :-) --Amy
#
#	Here, the layout is based partly on the Yeoman goal level, but only the upper half of it.
#
#	Of course you also meet Arabella, your nemesis monster. Her friends may be there, too.
